//The InvoiceID should be prefixed with "WEB" and should start at 1000. Example "WEB1000"
//The reason we recommend to start at 1000 is because the window that displays the orders in a list
//will sort them alphanumerically from left to right. When this happens order WEB10 will show up before WEB2.
//WEB100 will show up before WEB99. 
//This causes issues when the order numbers are not in the correct order when the end user goes looking for the order
